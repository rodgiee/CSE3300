For wildcard matching, we know a word matches if characters in both words:
    1. equal (ex. b = b, c = c)
    2. query has ? (? = all characters, ? = a, ? =b, ...)

Matching can be made by iterating through each character at the same index for both words and checking for differences.
We can also reduce checking by first checking if the lengths differ (ex. app?le could never equal to bee)
